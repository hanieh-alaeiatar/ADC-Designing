Wiring the ADS1115

Single-Ended Mode:
	1.	VDD: Connect to the power supply (2.0V - 5.5V).
	2.	GND: Connect to ground.
	3.	SCL and SDA: Connect to I²C bus.
	4.	A0, A1, A2, A3: Connect to analog input signals.

Differential Mode:
	•	Connect signal pairs to A0-A1 or A2-A3.

Example (Arduino Setup):
	•	VDD: 5V or 3.3V (depending on your logic level).
	•	GND: Ground.
	•	SCL: Analog pin A5 (for Arduino Uno).
	•	SDA: Analog pin A4 (for Arduino Uno).

Programming the ADS1115
	1.	I²C Address:
	•	Base address: 0x48.
	•	Configurable using the ADDR pin.
	2.	Libraries:
